# JavaScript30

Hello! I found this course by a guy called wesbos. His enthusiasm and love for Javascript ultimately meant I would take up this challenge! This is not my own work but the result of following the tutorial below. I decide to do this by watching the video once, pausing if I needed to take something in. Make notes on the steps such as, check for key press, add event listener etc.

Once the Video was complete I would try and go at it by myself to get the result I deseired. Ultimately if I got stuck and just couldn't figure it out I would return to the tutorial for that "ah-ha!" moment. 

These are some fantastic tutorials so please please please check out the course below and take up the javascript30 challenge.

## My own spin

That's right, once I have completed the Javascript30 challenge I will be making changes to each of these files to take what I have learned and make each of these ideas my own. Even with expereince in Javascript there are, as wesbos mentions, 1001 ways of doing this so it is always good to learn from another perspective.

Thanks for checking this out and be sure to check out the course and wesbos too!
